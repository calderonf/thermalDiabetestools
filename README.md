# thermalDiabetesTools

**thermalDiabetesTools** is a software tool designed to analyze a temporal series of thermal images captured using the FLIR One Pro camera. The tool aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on the analysis of temperature progression at various points on their feet.

## Features

- Import a temporal series of thermal images captured with the FLIR One Pro camera.
- Analyze the temperature progression over time at different points on the feet.
- Perform statistical analysis and modeling to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- Generate informative visualizations and reports to aid in decision-making.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thermalDiabetesTools.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and install the FLIR One Pro SDK from the official FLIR website: [FLIR One Pro SDK](https://www.flir.com/support/products/flir-one-gen-3/sdk/).

4. Configure the FLIR One Pro camera to capture thermal images and ensure it is properly connected to your computer.
