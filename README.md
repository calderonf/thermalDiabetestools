# ThermalDiabetesTools

**ThermalDiabetesTools** is a software tool designed to analyze a temporal series of thermal images captured using the FLIR One Pro camera. The tool aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on the analysis of temperature progression at various points on their feet.

## Features

- A library to capture and process thermal RGB and perform image registration of images captured with flir one pro cameras
- Import a temporal series of thermal images captured with the FLIR One Pro camera.
- Analyze the temperature progression over time at different points on the feet or at the complete feet.
- Perform statistical analysis and modeling to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- Generate informative visualizations and reports to aid in decision-making.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/calderonf/ThermalDiabetesTools.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the `ThermalDiabetesTools` application.

2. Import the temporal series of thermal images captured with the FLIR One Pro camera.

3. Perform the analysis to analyze the temperature progression at various points on the feet.

4. Utilize the statistical analysis and modeling capabilities to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

5. Generate visualizations and reports to assist in decision-making and further analysis.
